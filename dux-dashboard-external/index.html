        using data from university systems Pure and Subscribe.

        The purpose of this dashboard is to provide an overall readiness report
        on staff profile (and soon research projects).
      </div>

      <h2>Staff profiles</h2>
      <div>
        The new staff profile is driven by 25 data fields from Pure and
        Subscribe. Faculties can use this dashboard to help staff complete their
        new staff profile.
      </div>
