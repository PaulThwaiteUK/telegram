        The Digital User Experience (DUX) team is building new digital products
        using data from university systems Pure and Subscribe.

        The purpose of this dashboard is to provide an overall readiness report
        on staff profile (and soon research projects).
      </div>

      <h2>Staff profiles</h2>
      <div>
        The new staff profile is driven by 25 data fields from Pure and
        Subscribe. Faculties can use this dashboard to help staff complete their
        new staff profile.
