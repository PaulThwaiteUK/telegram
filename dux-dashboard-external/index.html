    <h1>Digital UX - Product readiness dashboard</h1>
    <div>The Digital User Experience (DUX) team is building new digital products using data from university systems Pure and Subscribe.  </div>
    <br>
    <div>The purpose of this dashboard is to provide an overall readiness report on staff profile (and soon research projects). </div>

    <h2>Staff profiles</h2>
    <div>The new staff profile is driven by 25 data fields from Pure and Subscribe.  Faculties can use this dashboard to help staff complete their staff profile. </div>
    <br>
    <div>For guidance on how to update the new staff profile, see our dedicated  <a href="https://sotonac.sharepoint.com/teams/staff-profile-guidance"  target="_blank" > staff profile guidance sharepoint</a> site.</div>
    <br>
    <div>For help with the dashboard, use the weekly clinic (Wednesday, 10:15am) with the DUX team in the first instance.  This will enable other faculties to benefit from your query. </div>
